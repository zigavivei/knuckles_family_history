Ecological art is not made in isolation, but rather through collaboration. I would like to thank my sister Fiamma for fervently urging me to continue making art and offering her invaluable expertise--my graduation project advisor, Scott Slovic, and the English Department's Director of Graduate Studies, Zack Turpin, for encouraging me to take the path less traveled by--my directed study professor, David Roon, for helping me to focus my vision and for providing me with a critical eye and practical advice for executing my process--and my mentor, the Acting Director of First Year Composition, Katie Krahn, for emphasizing the documentation of process and experimenting with different modes, which truly enabled me to achieve the many dimensions of my project.

Furthermore, this website would not have been possible without the expertise of CDIL, particularly the programming done by Julia Stone, Devin Becker and Evan Williamson. David Ausband and Peter Rebholz's work on the Idaho Wolf Project brought much needed documentation and study of Idaho's wolves. I'm also honored to feature Kieran Hughe's animation titled "Wolves and Trophic Cascade,"--a beautiful work and perfect case of synchronicity--as well as the Nimiipuu Protecting the Environment's presentations about wolves at the Wolf-Grizzly Summit.

In addition, I would like to extend gratitude to the numerous Idaho locals I've spoken with over the years, whose diversity of opinions surrounding wolves has helped me to broaden my scope of research and listen closely to the numerous viewpoints that define this landscape. Last but certainly not least, I thank the wolves for inspiring my fascination with interconnectivity, in all its peaceful and chaotic forms, that weaves our seemingly separate worlds together.
